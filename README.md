Hey friends! 
I am Lennard Dorst, and a full-stack developer (born in 2005). I love to ship smaller projects, but also stick to longer term builds. Besides of that I enjoy connecting with other builders on [buildspace](https://buildspace.so). 🦄


My hobby besides programming is definetly biking. I have done various tours, including my latest one from Kiel -> Copenhagen. 🚴🏼‍♂️
